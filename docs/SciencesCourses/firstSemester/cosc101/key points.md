**Computer** can be defined as an electronic device that takes data as input from the user, processes the data under control of set of instructions (called program),stores the data and generates result as output in a 
required format. 

Any digital computer carries out five functions as follows: 

1. Takes data as input. 
2. Stores the data/instructions in its memory and use them when required. 
3. Processes the data and converts it into useful information. 
4. Generates the output 
5. Controls all the above four steps.

Trying to use machines to solve mathematical problems can be traced to the early 

17th century. Wilhelm Schickhard, Blaise Pascal, and Gottfried Leibnitz were 

among mathematicians who designed and implemented calculators that were 

capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first multipurpose or programmable 

computing device was probably Charles Babbage's 

Difference Engine, which was begun in 1823 but never completed. In 1842, 

Babbage designed a more ambitious machine, called the Analytical Engine but 

unfortunately it was also only partially completed.                                                                                                                                **EVOLUTION AND GENERATIONS OF COMPUTERS                                                                                                                First Generation Computers**

computer plays its own part. A typical computer 

system consists of the following major components: 

- The central processing unit (CPU) 
- Main memory 
- Secondary storage devices 
- Input devices 
- Output devices 

**Central Processing Unit (CPU)** 

A CPU is brain of a computer. It is responsible for all functions and processes. 

The CPU is comprised of three main parts : 

* ***Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)***: Executes all arithmetic and logical operations. 

Arithmetic calculations like as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 

Logical operation like compare numbers, letters, or special characters 

* ***Control Unit (CU):*** controls and co-ordinates computer components. 
1. Read the code for the next instruction to be executed. 
1. Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction. 
1. Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory. 
1. Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register. 
1. If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct 

the hardware to perform the requested operation. 

**Main Memory** 

A memory is just like a store. It is used to store data and instructions. The memory of computer is broadly categories into two categories: 

- Internal or Main Memory (Primary) 
- External or Permanent Memory (Secondary) 

**Internal or Main memory** 

This is also known as the primary memory. It holds only those data and 

instructions on which computer is currently working. It is divided into two 

subcategories RAM and ROM. 

**RAM:** Random Access Memories are **volatile** in nature. As soon as the computer is 

switched off, the contents of memory are also lost. 

**ROM:** Read only memories. The storage is permanent, but it is read only memory. 

We cannot store new information in ROM. Several types of ROM are available: 

**PROM:** Programmable Read Only Memory; it can be programmed once as per 

user requirements. 

**EPROM:** Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory; the contents of the memory 

can be erased and store new data into the memory. 

**EEPROM:** Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory; in this type of 

memory the contents of a particular location can be changed without affecting 

the contents of other location. 

**External or Permanent Memory** 

This type of memory is also known as the secondary memory or non-volatile. 

Stores data and programs permanently, its retained after the power is turned off 

It is slower than main memory. For example: 

1. Hard drive (HD): A hard disk is part of a unit, often called a "disk drive," "hard 

drive," or "hard disk drive," that store and provides relatively quick access to large 

amounts of data on an electromagnetically charged surface or set of surfaces. 

2. Optical Disk: an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light as 

part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives 

can only read from discs, but recent drives are commonly both readers and 

recorders, also called burners or writers.

Input is any data the computer collects from people and from other devices. 

**Output devices** 

An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment used to 

communicate the results of data processing carried out by an information 

processing system (such as a computer) which converts the electronically 

generated information into human-readable form. 

**COMPUTER SOFTWARE** 

Computer cannot do anything on its own. It is the user who instructs computer; 

what to do, how to do and when to do. Software can 

be classified mainly into two categories namely System Software and Application Software. 

**System software** 

can be defined as sets of programs, responsible for running the computer, 

controlling various operations of computer systems and management of 

computer resources. Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter, and Assemblers etc 

**Application Software** 

Application software is a set of programs, which are written to perform specific 

tasks, Application 

software can be broadly classified into two types: 

1) Generalized packages 
1) Customized packages 

**Generalized Packages** 

These are user friendly software written to cater to user’s very general needs 

such as preparing documents, drawing pictures, database to manage 

data/information, preparing presentations, play games etc.Some of 

the generalized packages are listed below: 

- Word Processing Software (for preparing documents): E.g Word Perfect, 

MS-Word, OpenOffice.org Writer 

- Spreadsheets (Data Analysis): E.g Lotus Smart suites, MSExcel, OpenOffice.org Calc, Apple Numbers 
- Presentations: E.g Presentation Graphics, MS-PowerPoint, OpenOffice.org Impress 
- Database Management System: E.g MS-Access, OpenOffice.org Base, MSSQL Server, ORACLE 
- Graphics Tools: E.g Paint shop pro, Adobe Photoshop 

**Customized Packages** 

These are the applications that are customized (or developed) to meet the 

specific requirements of an organization/institution. For Example: Student 

information details, Payroll packages, inventory control etc. 

**INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEM** 

An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and 

the computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs. 

The operating system's tasks, in the most general sense, fall into six categories:(functions of os) 

1. **Processor management:** allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and 

deallocates processor when it is no longer required. 

2. **Memory management:** keeps tracks of primary memory i.e. what part of it 

is in use by whom, what part is not in use etc. and allocates the memory 

when a process or program requests it. 

3. **Device management:** keeps track of all devices. This is also called I/O 

controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how 

much time. 

4. **Storage management:** allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides 

who gets the resources. 

5. **Application interface:** Let application programmers use functions of the 

computer without having to directly keep track of all the details in the 

CPU's operation. 

6. **User interface:** brings structure to the interaction between a user and the 

computer. 

**TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS** 

- **Real-time operating system** (RTOS) - Real-time operating systems are used to 

control machinery, scientific instruments and industrial systems. 

- **Single-user, single task** - As the name implies, this operating system is designed 

to manage the computer so that one user can effectively do one thing at a time. 

- **Single-user, multi-tasking** - This is the type of operating system most people use 

on their desktop and laptop computers today 

- **Multi-user** - A multi-user operating system allows many different users to take 

advantage of the computer's resources simultaneously. 

**Categorization based on manufacturers** 

Following are some famous manufacturers of Operating Systems: 

1. Windows 
1. Linux OS 
1. Unix OS 
1. Mac OS 

**INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER PROGRAM PLANNING.** 

A computer is a useful tool for solving a great variety of problems. The following are some techniques/tools used in computer program planning: 

1. Algorithm 
1. Flowchart 
3. Pseudo code 
3. Decision table 

**ALGORITHM** 

An algorithm can be defined as a process that performs some finite sequence of 

operations in order to solve a given problem.(algorithm is a step by step procedure for solving a given problem) 

**Characteristics of a Good Algorithm** 

The following are characteristics of a good algorithm 

- There must be no ambiguity in any instruction. 
- There should not be uncertainty about which instruction to be executed 

next. 

- The algorithm must be finite, must terminate after a number of steps. 
- Must be general enough to deal with any contingency. 

**Advantages of algorithm** 

- It is a step-by-step representation of a solution to a given problem, which is 

very easy to understand. 

- It provides a definite procedure. 
- It is independent of programming language. 
- It is easy to debug as every step has its own logical sequence 

**Disadvantages of algorithm** 

It is time consuming & cumbersome as an algorithm is developed first which is 

then converted into flowchart and into a computer program. 

**Type of Algorithms** 

Algorithm has three types of control structures. They are: 

1. Sequence 
1. Branching (Selection) 
1. Loop (Repetition) 

These three control structures are sufficient for all purposes. 

- The sequence is exemplified by sequence of statements place one after the 

other – the one above or before another gets executed first. 

- The *branch* refers to a binary decision based on some condition. 
- The *loop* allows a statement or a sequence of statements to be repeatedly 

executed based on some loop condition. 

**Examples of Algorithm** 

Example 1: Find the area of a Circle of radius r. 

**Inputs to the algorithm:** 

Radius r of the Circle. 

**Expected output:** 

Area of the Circle 

**Algorithm:** 

Step1: Read\input the Radius r of the Circle 

Step2: Area PI\*r\*r // calculation of area 

Step3: Print Area

**FLOWCHART** 

A flowchart can therefore be seen as a 

type of diagram (graphical or symbolic) that represents an algorithm or process.**Flowcharting Symbols** 

![](Aspose.Words.38a6b95c-e988-4598-883c-f5e89fe5189f.007.png)

![](Aspose.Words.38a6b95c-e988-4598-883c-f5e89fe5189f.009.jpeg)

` `**General Rules for flowcharting** 

1. All boxes of the flowchart are connected with Arrows. (Not lines) 
1. Flowchart symbols have an entry point on the top of the symbol with no other entry points. The exit point for all flowchart symbols is on the bottom except for the Decision symbol. 
1. The Decision symbol has two exit points; these can be on the sides or the bottom and one side. 
1. Generally a flowchart will flow from top to bottom. However, an upward flow can be shown as long as it does not exceed 3 symbols. 
1. Connectors are used to connect breaks in the flowchart. Examples are: 
- From one page to another page. 
- From the bottom of the page to the top of the same page. 
- An upward flow of more than 3 symbols 
6. All flow charts start with a Terminal or Predefined Process (for interrupt programs or subroutines) symbol. 
6. All flowcharts end with a terminal or a contentious loop 

**Advantage of using Flowchart** 

Some of the benefits of flowcharts are as follows: 

1) Communication: Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of a 

system to all concerned. 

2) Effective analysis: With the help of flowchart, problem can be analyzed in more 

effective way. 

3) Proper documentation: Program flowcharts serve as a good program 

documentation, which is needed for various purposes. 

4) Efficient Coding: The flowcharts act as a guide or blueprint during the systems 

analysis and program development phase. 

5) Proper Debugging: The flowchart helps in debugging process. 
5) Efficient Program Maintenance: The maintenance of operating program 

becomes easy with the help of flowchart. 

**Limitation of using flowcharts** 

1) Complex logic: Sometimes, the program logic is quite complicated. In that case, 

flowchart becomes complex and clumsy. 

2) Alterations and Modifications: If alterations are required the flowchart may 

require re-drawing completely. 

3) Reproduction: As the flowchart symbols cannot be typed, reproduction of 

flowchart becomes a problem. 

4) The essentials of what is done can easily be lost in the technical details of how 

it is done. 

**Examples Flowcharts**                                                                                                                              **Pseudocode** is a generic way of describing an algorithm without use of any specific programming language syntax. 

**Benefits of Pseudocodes** 

Pseudocode provides a simple method of developing a program as it uses 

everyday language to prepare a brief set of instructions in the order in which they 

appear in the completed program. 

Language independent 

Easier to develop a program from pseudocode than a flowchart 

Easy to translate pseudocode into a programming language 

Pseudocode is compact and does not tend to run over many pages 

**Limitations of Pseudo Code** 

It does not provide visual representation of the program’s logic. 

No accepted standards style of writing pseudo codes. 

cannot be compiled or executed and there is no real formatting or syntax rules 

**Example 1:** Suppose you are required to design an algorithm for finding the 

average of three numbers, and the sum of the numbers is given. The pseudocode 

will be as follows: 

*Start* 

*Get the sum* 

*Average = sum / 3* 

*Output the average* 

*Stop* 

**DECISION TABLE** 

A decision table is a way of representing an 

algorithm in a tabular form. It consists of rows and columns, divided into four quadrants as follows: 

![](Aspose.Words.38a6b95c-e988-4598-883c-f5e89fe5189f.010.png)

` `**Conditions:** contains a list of all possible conditions pertaining to a problem. **Condition Alternatives:** contains the condition rules (set of possible values for each condition) of alternatives. 

**Actions:** Contains the action rules, which can be a procedure or operation to be performed. 

**Action Entries:** contains the action rules which specified the action to be performed on the basis of the set of condition alternatives corresponding to that action entry 

**Example** 

A student can only be admitted into Gombe State University through UTME with a UTME pass mark of not less than 160 and required O level passes. Draw a decision table for the above case. 

![](Aspose.Words.38a6b95c-e988-4598-883c-f5e89fe5189f.011.jpeg)

` `**Benefits of decision tables** 

A decision table is generally preferred over flowchart because of the following: 

It is easier to draw and modify 

For algorithms having complex problem solving logic, a flowchart may take a 

number of pages unlike decision table. 

**COMPUTER THREATS AND SECURITY** 

To prevent theft of or damage to the hardware 

To prevent theft of or damage to the information 

To prevent disruption of service 

**Definition** 

Computer Security is the protection afforded to computer networks in order to 

attain the fundamental objectives of preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of system resources, which includes hardware, software, firmware, information or data, and telecommunications. 

1. Confidentiality of systems and communications. This is a requirement to avoid unauthorized disclosure of systems and communications either intentionally or inadvertently. 
   2. Integrity of computer networks, data and information. This is a requirement aimed to ascertain that computer networks and their offered services are accurate, complete, consistent, authentic and timely. 
   2. Availability of computer networks and its offered services. This is a requirement to ensure systems and their offered services are available at accepted levels to legitimate entities. 

**Threats** to computer networks are defined as entities, events or circumstances with the capability to inflict harm or distort normal security operations by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems. 

**Computer Virus** 

A computer virus is a program that may disturb the normal working of a computer system. Virus attaches itself to files stored on floppy disks, USBs, email attachments and hard disks.

**Types of Computer Virus**                                                                                                                                                         **Causes of Computer Virus** 

The following are the main causes of a Computer Virus. 

**Infected Flash Drives or Disks** 

Flash drives and disks are the main cause of spreading viruses. 

**Email Attachments** 

Most of the viruses spread through emails. Email attachment is a file that is sent 

along with an email. An email may contain an infected file attachment. 

**Infected / Pornography websites** 

Thousands of insecure websites can infect computer with viruses. Most of the 

websites with pornographic materials are infected, so by visiting these websites 

the user’s computer also gets infected by virus. 

**Networks** 

Virus can spread if an infected computer is connected to a network. 

**Pirated Software** 

An illegal copy of software is called pirated software. Virus can spread if user 

installs pirated software that contains a virus. 

**Protection from Computer Virus** 

A computer system can be protected from virus by following these precautions. 

1. The latest and updated version of Anti-Virus and firewall should be installed on 

the computer. 

2. The Anti-Virus software must be upgraded regularly. 
2. USB drives should be scanned for viruses, and should not be used on infected 

computers. 

4. Junk or unknown emails should not be opened and must be deleted 

straightaway 

5. Unauthorized or pirated software should not be installed on the computer. 
5. An important way of protection against virus is the use of back up of data. 
5. Freeware and shareware software from the internet normally contain viruses. 

It is important to check the software before using them. 

8. Your best protection is your common sense. Never click on suspicious links, 

never download songs, videos or files from suspicious websites. 

**INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING** 

A computer program is a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming Language to perform a specified task by the computer. Computer program instructions are also called program source code and 

**computer programming** is also called **program coding**. 

**Compiler** 

You write your computer program using your favorite programming language and 

save it in a text file called the program file. Now let us try to get a little more 

detail on how the computer understands a program written by you using a programming language. 

**Data Types** 

As its name indicates, a data type represents a type of the data which you can 

process using your computer program. It can be numeric, alphanumeric, decimal, 

etc. 

**Variables** 

Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used 

to store values in a computer program. Here are the following three simple steps: 

1. Create variables with appropriate names. 

   2. Store your values in those two variables. 
   2. Retrieve and use the stored values from the variables. 

Example1: 

{i 

nt a; 

int b; 

} 

The above program creates two variables to reserve two memory locations with names **a** and **b**. We created these variables using **int** keyword to specify variable **data type** which means we want to store integer values in these two variables.Similarly, you can create variables to store **long**, **float**, **char**, or any other data type. Example2: 

{i 

nt a; 

int b; 

a = 10; 

b = 20; 

} 

**Rules for Constructing Variable Name** 

1. **Characters Allowed :** 
- Underscore(\_) 
- Capital Letters ( A – Z ) 
- Small Letters ( a – z ) 
- Digits ( 0 – 9 ) 
2. **Blanks & Commas** are not allowed 
2. No Special Symbols other than **underscore(\_) are allowed** 
2. **First Character** should be **alphabet or Underscore** 
2. Variable name Should not be **Reserved Word**
